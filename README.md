About me
--------

I graduated from the university with two degrees. At the moment I am getting a master's degree in mathematics and computer science. I decided to change my speciality because I see myself as a developer. My personal qualities are: sociability, stress tolerance and discipline, I was fully convinced of this after serving in the army.

Code Example
------------

    function showPrimes(n) {
        for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (!isPrime(i)) continue;
            alert(i);
        }
    }

    function isPrime(n) {
        for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if ( n % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
